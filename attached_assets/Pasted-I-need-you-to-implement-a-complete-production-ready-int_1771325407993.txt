I need you to implement a complete, production-ready internationalization (i18n) system for my entire web application.

This must be clean, scalable, and fully refactored. Do NOT implement a quick workaround. This needs to be architected properly.

🎯 OBJECTIVE

Add full multilingual support for:

🇮🇹 Italian (default)

🇬🇧 English

🇪🇸 Spanish

The user must be able to switch languages from the top-right corner of the navbar, next to the "Log In" section.

Language selection must instantly update all UI text across the entire website.

🧱 ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS
1️⃣ Create Proper i18n Structure

Create a /locales folder with:

/locales/it.json

/locales/en.json

/locales/es.json

Each file must contain ALL application text structured hierarchically, for example:

{
  "navbar": {
    "login": "Log In",
    "signup": "Sign Up"
  },
  "homepage": {
    "title": "Plan your perfect bachelorette party",
    "subtitle": "Unique experiences across Italy"
  }
}


All existing hardcoded text across the project must be removed and replaced with translation keys.

2️⃣ Implement Translation Engine

Implement a clean translation system:

Create a global language context / provider

Create a useTranslation() hook (or equivalent)

Implement a t("key.path") function

Add fallback handling if a key is missing

Ensure zero duplicated logic

Do NOT reload the entire page on language change.

3️⃣ Language Persistence

Default language: Italian

When user selects a language:

Update UI instantly

Save selection in localStorage

Restore language on page refresh

Update <html lang=""> dynamically

4️⃣ UI Language Selector

In the navbar, next to "Log In", add:

Three circular flag icons:

🇮🇹

🇬🇧

🇪🇸

Size: 20–24px

Clean, minimal design

Subtle hover effect

Active state indicator (border or opacity)

Smooth micro-animation on selection

Order must be:
🇮🇹 🇬🇧 🇪🇸

It must visually match the ByeBi elegant aesthetic.

5️⃣ FULL PROJECT REFACTOR

You must:

Replace ALL hardcoded strings in:

Navbar

Homepage

Footer

Forms

Buttons

Errors

Modals

Any static text

Ensure no text remains outside the translation system

Maintain existing styling and layout

Do not break functionality

6️⃣ Future Scalability

Prepare the system for future routing like:

/it

/en

/es

Even if not fully implemented, the structure must allow easy extension.

7️⃣ Quality Standards

The implementation must be:

Modular

Maintainable

Clean

Production-ready

No hacks

No inline translation objects inside components

No duplicated code

8️⃣ Optional Enhancements (If Feasible)

Fade transition when language changes

Automatic fallback to Italian if translation missing

Lazy load locale files for performance

This is a structural upgrade of the entire app.

Do not implement a partial solution.
Refactor the whole system correctly.
